I have been working in Design for four years, currently specializing in User Experience, and I am seeking a job opportunity in Europe. My journey as a Product Designer is enriched daily through the practical application of design systems and proficiency in Figma, while I continue my studies in Design and Visual Communication at La Salle University. Valuing creativity and innovation is at the core of my professional activity, where I constantly seek aesthetically appealing and functionally robust solutions for the challenges presented.

The experience I have accumulated in UX/UI design allows me not only to view problems from a new perspective but also to develop and implement effective solutions that meet user needs. With a collaborative and proactive spirit, I integrate teams to transform ideas into products that resonate with the audience, reflecting my commitment to excellence in design and my passion for sharing creative visions of the world.
